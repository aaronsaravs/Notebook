I decided on my object. My Parris Manufacturing Toy gun. I bought it from an Antinques boutique, and it has a really interesting history.
I decided to record my attempts with photographs, to track my methods.
I tried simply taking the pictures of my gun, but it caputured my living room, and produce a spherical mess of images.
At this point I forgot to cancel my three day trial period and incured a 50.99 dollar charge and own the app for a year!
I tried taking pictures of it in a better lit enviroment with a white box behind it, but could not get around the object.
I hung the gun off my ceiling and walked around it, I had the same issue i did in my first attempt.
I made a contraption that could hold a white cardboard flap behind my object as i walked around it, the imagine came out distorted and flat
I used the new pictures to edit out the background using photoshop, but SCANN3D did not even render the images when I imported them
I created a white sheet tent in my living room, with two lamps and hung the gun in the middle. I walked around it taking over 20 pictures
the image came out flat and distorted.
At this point I became concerned that i would not have a model, therefore I scanned a clay fist I made in Grade 10 art class. I title the assignment "Mother Nature" at the time.
I've decided to use the clay model in the mean time while still hoping for success with my toy gun. I created the the clay fist, meaning i know everything there is to know about it, and can't learn from the object itself. The gun has a manufacturer, and owners before me, and has been restored before. I could learn from both the object, and the proccess of digitizing it. The clay fist makes for quite a boring subject. Maybe I should have had a backup plan.
