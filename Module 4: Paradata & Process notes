-**PROCESS NOTES**-
For my module 4, I decided to go with the generonimos G showed us in class.
At first I thought of doing the 3D model, and i found the generonimos dumb and confusing. When he showed them in class I was waiting
for him to press on the card that said "button" and start an animation that never came. 
The 3D model would have been boring. I thought about doing a Little Big Planet game and recording my gameplay. After realising the
endless posibilities of creating a game with LBP, I realized the Generonimos were exactly that... A blueprint for a Little Big Planet 
Game.
the Generonimos are also more visual, that i can see if something doesn't work, instead of having Twine break it (Which would be be
awesome for class), and having me guess why.
I also realized I have no idea how to use github, I asumed if i made a space and a soft warp, that's how it would appear in the final
product. 
I want my model to be interactive, So I want to incorporate touch and sound. I would like to incorporate smell, but there is something
still silly about that to me which I can't get around.
I've decided to create a Museum exhibit. This would give me a perfect setting and justification for why someone is touching my model. 
That means my model would be a statue, maybe "Average size" like 5"8. 
I've decided that the size and "imprortance" of the statue out weighs the need for it to be accessible. If I made it small it would 
not have the same grandios nature of the object. 
I don't know much about tech, so the trigger on the fist, robe, and arm will resemble this https://goo.gl/zejqZo
This would trigger two things, a projector on a screen across the statue from your position, and sound box behind the individual away
from the projected screen. 
This idea is based on a section of the Canadian History Hall at the Canadian History Museum.
The exhibit section is about a speech a mister Charles de Gaulle gave, the content isn't important. The section of the Exhibit has Mt
Gaulle making his speech, one you can hear it (he's on a tv screen) but behind the viewer, there is a speaker with the sound of a crowd
playing. 
This gives a sense of presence to the whole expo, and I want that! that's interactivity.
So my room will be compleatly dark, except for my statue which will be my module 2 model. https://goo.gl/wGfwZn
The statue will be lit up, and when an individual touches the Fist, across from him one will see the screen projected with Muhammad Ali
All the information that will be presented will be the information about what the objects in my module 3 experience contributed to Civil
Rights. 
To use more in class tools, i want the sounds to comprised of ImaginarySoundScape2 results such as these:

https://goo.gl/gYbxNp
https://goo.gl/hhZRh7
I think this would work, I don't see why not. I created my own Generonimos after not being able to find the ones showed in class.
-**PARADATA**-
I believe the Factum Foundation reading (https://goo.gl/hhZRh7) is relevant to My prpposed exhibition, in how the two are different.
My exhibit doesn't claim to be a replica, or a copy, but it represents symbols. My exhibit is comprised of symbolism which relates to
civil Rights.
This doesn't liberate me from controversy. Muhammad Ali has layers of controversy around conscription. 
That statue of liberty could raise question about whether or not Western Capitalism really is freedom?
And the Civil rights salute's of either Black Power or Civil Rights is still in questin. Today acts of defiance during sporting events
and national anthems is littered with controvercy. 
People could exit my Exhibition with complaints about whether these two acertive athletic civil right proponent are heroes or vilains.
The difference between this exhibition and the Factum Foundation event is my respect for the source. I'm not claiming the center piece
is a representation of Muhammad Ali, or that its a replica of his glove. I claim that a boxing glove is indicative of his person and 
career. Same goes for the Robe and the Arm.
The meaning is attributed by the information which will be presented on the projections, and interpreted by the audience.
--- In relation to the Zena Kamash reading (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.2017.1406399?journalCode=rwar20). 
My exhibit will be interpreted by the visitors. But i'm definately shaping and curating the exhibit. The statue will be black, the 
lights will be off. I will chose information relevant to the statue of libery and the athleets' acheivements, but not their 
controversies outside of civil rights. 
My goal with the exhibit is to bring life to the experience with sounds, touch, and sight.
I'm wondering about the fist now. As it started from my first Module. 
I created the fist in highschool, it was meant to represent the power of nature and enviromentalism.
I don't believe, in my own opinion, that it's meaning has been perverted. Because it still stands as a symbol of perceveirance and 
strength.
As the profesor(Dr. Shawn Graham) brought up in class, I failed to speak on the shaping of the angel from the tombstone. I failed to 
find records of who is buried there, but about the idea that i'm taking the tombstone of a dead person, and using it in an exhibition
is highly problematic.
I don't know if the dead person is a white supremasist, or maybe just a regular person who would mind their tomb used in such a 
publicly symbolic way.
I do feel better knowing that the person who scanned the model in the first place commited the first sin though.
