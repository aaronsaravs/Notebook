I believe the final product and it's quality should be weighed heavily, as the aim of the module. The process notes which are important should remain the same. The Annotations, I find the conversations i'm expected to have on hypothesis are conversations I have outside of my notes. I would go crazy doing these assignments on my own, so I ask my friends what they're doing and how they are doing it, and what they thought of the readings, and if they will include them in their final module products. I don't find myself writing those conversations down enough to take note of them and include them in a writen format. Although they are clearly stated as due, I wouldn't eliminate them because if I was doing the assignment right, I would be creating the annotaions and commenting on them despite it not coming about naturaly, but even so I don't believe they should be held to the same standard as the Final product. I also combined the Paradata with the anotations because I believe they both represent evidence of reading and interacting with the assigned readings and the class lecture.
