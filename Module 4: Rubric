Almost the same Rubric and Same justification as Module 3

I believe the final product and it's quality should be weighed heavily, as the aim of the module. The process notes which are 
important should remain the same. The Annotations, I find the conversations i'm expected to have on hypothesis are conversations 
I have outside of my notes. I would go crazy doing these assignments on my own, so I ask my friends what they're doing and how 
they are doing it, and what they thought of the readings, and if they will include them in their final module products. I don't 
find myself writing those conversations down enough to take note of them and include them in a writen format. Although they are 
clearly stated as due, I wouldn't eliminate them because if I was doing the assignment right, I would be creating the annotaions 
and commenting on them despite it not coming about naturaly, but even so I don't believe they should be held to the same standard 
as the Final product.(I've further adjusted this, realizing I was weighing the Annotations similarly as the Paradata didn't 
feel accurate, as the paradata is the essensial tying of the Class and the module together, and the annotations was refering to 
the active reading and collaboration, which does happen, and I just fail to document).
