final test
I believe i've figured out how to use github. I've decided on an object, that is my toy gun from Parris Manufacturing. After taking 77 pictures of the object, the Scann3D app Failed to even calibrate the pictures. I'll try again in better lighting. the best result i've had was my Burt's and Bees lip balm model.
I have been trying to form my model of my Pariss. Manufacturing toy gun for three days. I tried simply taking a picture of it with SCANN3D. It recorded my living room and created a spherical model with no diserning image. I used three different methods, all of which have failed: White paper background, mobile white background contraption, 360* white sheet tent.
I tried photo shopping the entirity of the background as white and importing the pictures to SCANN3D. it produced a distorted flat image. The last attempt qith the 360* sheet tent produced a similar distorted image. (I have picture of all my three attemmpts and contraptions)
I made a Scan model of a clay hand I created myself in grade 10 so as to not get caught without a model, as my Toy Gun proved impossible to scan properly. I tries using a higher quality phone with no success. I tried for 5 hours to take different angles and lightings and wasn't able to. I've decided to try again and only scan the part of the gun with the trigger, inscription, and hammer. It has been extremly frustrating, as i thought it would be a quick proccess to create the model itself, as it was a small item I already had access in my own home. 

I decided to combine two 3D Models together, my clay fist, with a statue to form a figure holding it's fist up.
I found one open source cementary statue of an angel. downloaded it
I downloaded Blender and was able to import the angel model. I managed to open it by going uner "file" and selecting "link" and selecting the angel file
I wasn't able to upload my own model, it does not appear in the file option under "link" or "apendage" almost like the file isn't compatible.
I tried emailing the file to myself from Scann3d and downloading it onto my laptop, it worked, but the file is empty, i tried extracting it from my windows files, it didn't work. I tried unzipping it online (http://online.b1.org/online), it shows empty. 
I tried sending it from scann3d to my google dive, it works, but when I try to download it from google drive, i go through the exact same problems of the files being empty. I can see the files on my Drive such as the textures, and the mesh, and the source. But I can't download them.
after reviewing my notes I noticed Blender was not even listed as a recomended editing tool, I downloaded Meshlab, and imideately ran into the same problem which is the editor canot read my files. I downloaded from SketchLab, my Email, or Google Drive. I'm starting to believe my Laptop might be the problem.
downloaded Meshmixer, same problem.
So far the furthest I have gotten is opening the Cemetary angel onto Blender and moving it around.
After thinking about what the professor said about trying to break the model and creating something new, I redownloaded all 3 sources (gmail, sketchlab, drive) and started moving things around in windows files and created a "ModelFF" file with diferent sources in it, I then double clicked one of the .OBJ files and it opened, in MeshLab(which i asume i've accidentaly set as a default program). The fist I scanned into Scann3d, better then the one I submitted for module 1. I do not know which of the sources produced the model. 
For the record I shed a tear when it happened(really)
I quickly learned how to edit parts off my new model fist, when i was ready I found out I can't upload the Angel onto Meshlab, because MeshLab does not support the "blend" file
I went into blender and saved the angel as a OBJ. file. I then loaded it into MeshLab, but after two errors, it loaded it without the realistic stone texture, and loaded a Dark grey and light grey checkered pattern.
after apending the fist into the angel model, I learned how to transform the fist by myself, but I googled how to "Delete" and how to "mirror".
When i scaled it down and manipulated it, i found out the fist was left handed, and the angel hand its right hand in the air, after a quick search I found that scaling it to -1 solved the issue.
after fidling manualy, i finaly scaled it and angeled it right.
Saving it took 2 hours, and i still did not get it right. I tried saving it and reopening it in all possible file formats and none worked. It looked perfect, but I had to save it in a Meshlab file and upload that to SketchLab. 
The uploaded 3D Model has no texture or color, just white. But it retained all of its shape.
