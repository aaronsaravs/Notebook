final test
I believe i've figured out how to use github. I've decided on an object, that is my toy gun from Parris Manufacturing. After taking 77 pictures of the object, the Scann3D app Failed to even calibrate the pictures. I'll try again in better lighting. the best result i've had was my Burt's and Bees lip balm model.
I have been trying to form my model of my Pariss. Manufacturing toy gun for three days. I tried simply taking a picture of it with SCANN3D. It recorded my living room and created a spherical model with no diserning image. I used three different methods, all of which have failed: White paper background, mobile white background contraption, 360* white sheet tent.
I tried photo shopping the entirity of the background as white and importing the pictures to SCANN3D. it produced a distorted flat image. The last attempt qith the 360* sheet tent produced a similar distorted image. (I have picture of all my three attemmpts and contraptions)
I made a Scan model of a clay hand I created myself in grade 10 so as to not get caught without a model, as my Toy Gun proved impossible to scan properly. I tries using a higher quality phone with no success. I tried for 5 hours to take different angles and lightings and wasn't able to. I've decided to try again and only scan the part of the gun with the trigger, inscription, and hammer. It has been extremly frustrating, as i thought it would be a quick proccess to create the model itself, as it was a small item I already had access in my own home.
