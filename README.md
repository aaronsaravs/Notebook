final test
I believe i've figured out how to use github. I've decided on an object, that is my toy gun from Parris Manufacturing. After taking 77 pictures of the object, the Scann3D app Failed to even calibrate the pictures. I'll try again in better lighting. the best result i've had was my Burt's and Bees lip balm model.
